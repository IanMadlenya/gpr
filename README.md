OCaml-GPR - Efficient Gaussian Process Regression in OCaml
==========================================================

This library implements some of the newest approximation algorithms
(e.g. _SPGP_) to scalable Gaussian process regression in OCaml for arbitrary
covariance functions.  Here is an example graph showing the fit of a sparse
Gaussian process to a nonlinear function:

[GPR manual](https://bitbucket.org/mmottl/gpr/downloads/gpr_manual.pdf) for further
details.
