Here is an example graph showing the fit of such a\r\nsparse Gaussian process to a nonlinear function:\r\n\r\n  ![Sparse Gaussian Process](http://mmottl.github.io/gpr/fit.png \"Sparse Gaussian Process\")\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [GPR manual](http://mmottl.github.io/gpr/gpr_manual.pdf)\r\nfor further details and to the [online API\r\ndocumentation](http://mmottl.github.io/gpr/api) as programming reference.\r\n\r\nMarkus Mottl in Rutherford, NJ on July 14, 2012\r\n",
