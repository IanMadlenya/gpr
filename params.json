Here is an example graph showing the fit of such a\r\nsparse Gaussian process to a nonlinear function:\r\n\r\n  ![Sparse Gaussian Process](https://bitbucket.org/mmottl/gpr/downloads/fit.png \"Sparse Gaussian Process\")\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [GPR\r\nmanual](https://bitbucket.org/mmottl/gpr/downloads/gpr_manual.pdf)\r\nfor further details and to the [online API\r\ndocumentation](http://mmottl.bitbucket.org/projects/gpr/api/) as programming\r\nreference.\r\n\r\nMarkus Mottl in Rutherford, NJ on July 14, 2012\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
